# üìù IngrEasy - About the Project

**IngrEasy** is an **API** developed in **.NET**, designed to simplify the management of ingredients and recipes. With an architecture based on **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, the application allows users to register, edit, and organize their recipes, as well as add, edit, and delete ingredients easily. The API also integrates with **GPT**, allowing for intelligent suggestions to optimize recipes and ingredient combinations.

The project structure is organized in a modular way, ensuring easy scalability and maintenance. Data is securely stored using **MySQL** or **SQL Server**, and the API is documented with **Swagger** to facilitate usage and integration by other developers.
